## Installation

* Things have changed...
 If you are downloading from SourceForge or downloading a release from GitHub, you don't need to have composer installed to add the project dependencies as they are bundled with the project.
 If, however, you are cloning from github, you must run composer install to get the latest changes as new dependencies are being added all the time and the vendor directory is no longer in version control.
* Unpack the zip archive.
* Place the contents of the /public directory inside your document root.
* All other directories should be placed outside of the document root and not accessible via a web browser (look at the above diagram to see the structure).
* The mod_rewrite module (if using apache server) will need to be enabled in your server configuration.
* Create a MySQL database called 'simple-quiz'
* Import simple-quiz.sql into MySQL using a tool like phpmyadmin.
* Change credentials in /SimpleQuiz/Utils/Base/Config.php to suit.
* Default web admin user is example@gmail.com with password of 123456
* Remember to change admin password from within phpMyadmin. Make sure password is sha1 hashed.
* Navigate to the web accessible folder in your browser.
